IN PROGRESS
TESTS
Test map generation
try to find edge cases for rover movement(besides the obvious out of bounds)

ASSETS
add mildly comedic messages for out of bounds and bad terain

    TYPES
        MAP
            add option to generate forbidden squares(maybe a param for %?)

        TOOLS
            figure out a better way of assgining functions
            (optional) add more tools
        VEHICLES
            figure out how to assign tools to vics
            modify the rover (and other vics in future) declarations to have the inital postions be grid maximums/2 to support variable grid size
            similarly have returnToOrigin() set the rovers postion to grid maximums/2
            add out of range and fobidden destination checks to moveRover()
