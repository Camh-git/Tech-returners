IN PROGRESS
TESTS
Test map generation
try to find edge cases for rover movement(besides the obvious out of bounds)

ASSETS

    TYPES
        MAP
            add option to generate forbidden squares(maybe a param for %?)

        TOOLS
            figure out a better way of assgining functions
            (optional) add more tools
        VEHICLES
            figure out how to assign tools to vics
            modify the rover (and other vics in future) declarations to have the inital postions be grid maximums/2 to support variable grid size
            find way to convert moveRover()'s target switch to an arrow function, will let it be const

NOT STARTED
add rotation/facing directions to the rover

FINISHED
add mildly comedic messages for out of bounds and bad terain
refactor moveRover's out of bounds checks to something less verbose(if reasons for odd return/asign behaviour can be found) (was changed to seperate function for all vics)
add out of range and fobidden destination checks to moveRover()
Have both rotate and move in the same file if it makes sense
