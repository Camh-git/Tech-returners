        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
          Tim Berners Lee dreamt of a World Wide Web that would be free and
          accessible to everyone. Sadly, the modern web is littered with poorly
          designed websites and difficult to navigate code (for both developers
          and users). This often comes down to a lack of understanding around
          different user needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Designing pages that are accessible for everyone shouldn’t be too
          difficult. The developers at Tech Returners News have collated an
          ‘easy wins' checklist for Web page accessibility.

          Keep this guide handy… When creating your own websites you can check
          these criteria off the list!

        <h4>Accessibility checks</h4>
        <p>
          Heading elements & Page Titles: HTML heading elements have been used
          to represent page structure, supporting assistive technologies that
          allow page navigation from heading to heading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Re-size Text: You can vary text size by using your browser's text
          resize settings (through Options or Preferences), text-only zoom, page
          zoom (which also zooms images, buttons etc) without incurring styling
          issues / text over-lapping or being cut off the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternative text for images: All images have been given appropriate
          alternative text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Link text: All hyperlinks should make sense when read out of context,
          and hyperlinks are clearly presented in a different text style from
          normal body text. If a link opens in a new browser page, it has been
          labelled as doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript independence: Where JavaScript or other scripts are used
          for navigation or functionality, an alternative mechanism has been put
          in place in case your browser does not support these scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colour contrast: has been checked for text and background colour
          combinations to ensure that the contrast is sufficient and I have also
          ensured that information is not referenced by colour alone
        </p>
        <p>
          Style sheets: If style sheets are not supported or are turned off,
          information on the site can still be accessed and read.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forms: forms are marked up correctly so people can interact with them
          using only the keyboard, voice input or screen readers. The form
          labels themselves are clickable, increasing the target area and making
          it easier to select small radio buttons of checkboxes.
        </p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          By spending just a little more time on getting the building blocks of
          the web right, developers can help create an Internet that works for
          everyone.
