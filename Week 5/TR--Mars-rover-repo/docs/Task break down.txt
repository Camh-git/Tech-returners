setup ts enviro
setup file structure(from reading brief: add src folder with code, tests folder and prob a types folder)
create map
implement a rover type (make a generic vic type for expandability)
add tests for map/rover and it's movement
write code to implement the rotation and movement functions
test and retest until they work
MVP here <-----------
try and get user input

extra:
implent a tool type, make sure the rovers have a list of tools
add ui, prob web, but maybe investigate less code heavy options
add signal delay
mildly comedic out of bounds messages

notes:
have out of bounds checks for anything that moves
if u do add signal delay set default to 0, ppl wont appreciate waiting 20 mins
keep a todo so you dont forget small details that need fixing ffs
REMEMBER- a readme is needed, go to the guides to make it look good
